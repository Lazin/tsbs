# TSBS Supplemental Guide: InfluxDB

Akumuli is an open-source time-series database written in C++ with. 
performance in mind. This guide explains how to use TSBS to generate
test data and run the tests.

## Data format

Data generated by `tsbs_generate_data` for Akumuli is serialized in a
dictionary-based RESP format. The header of the file contains dictionary entries. 
Every entry contains unique series name and id. 
The header is followed by data-points which are using ids instead of full series names. 
The text data in the input file is interleaved with binary data 
wich acts as a cue for `tsbs_load_akumuli` tool. It uses them for emulating 
realclients that send data independently without actually parsing the messages.
